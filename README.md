It is the 3rd task completed during my Encryptix Internship. In this task, I built a virtual calculator where inputs can be given using <br>
the mouse or the keyboard (though there are some glitches with keyboard input).<br>
I utilized basic JavaScript concepts, including string manipulation. Additionally,<br>
I learned various CSS properties, including Flexbox and Grid layout.
